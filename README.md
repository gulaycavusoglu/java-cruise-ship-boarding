# Cruise Ship Boarding System (Java)

A Java-based cruise ship boarding system developed for a university project. The system facilitates the assignment of passengers to cabins, enables searching cabins by customer name, supports passenger deletion, and provides alphabetical display of passenger names. This project aims to streamline cabin assignment management for efficient passenger allocation on a cruise ship.

- Press `V` to see the cabins.
- Press `A` to add customers to the cabins.
- Press `Q` to access additional menu options.

### Additional Menu Options

Once you press `Q`, the following options will be available:

- Press `E` to display the empty cabins.
- Press `D` to delete a customer from a cabin.
- Press `F` to find a cabin by customer name.
- Press `O` to view passengers ordered alphabetically by name.

## Running the Program

To run the program:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).
3. Build and run the `Cruiseship_git.java` file.
